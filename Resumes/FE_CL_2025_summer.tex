Dear Hiring Manager, \\

\vspace{0.5em}
I am a Computer Science and Business undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, and I am excited to apply for roles in frontend/backend development.

With hands-on experience across the software development stack and a strong foundation in both technical and analytical thinking, I enjoy building user-centric applications and working with data to drive decisions, and hope to grow as a developer while contributing to impactful products.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
